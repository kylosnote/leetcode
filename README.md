This is a repository to store answer to leetcode question with added comment for reference.

Often time the top ranked solutions for leetcode question have top notch performance in term of runtime/memory

However a lot of time are using non dev friendly way of coding or they are exploiting the weakness in testcase.

Thus my goal here is to maintain a educational repository for myself and maybe others.

With that being said, there is also room for improvement with my solution in term of better usage of built-in function or usage of simpler logic flow or more dev friendly logic writing style.
